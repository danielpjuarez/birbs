	<h3> Casual user story </h3>
	<p>As a casual user of this website I want to be able to quickly access information about birds I encounter, add
		information about where I found them, and quickly add them to my favorite list (because this stuff is fun!).</p>

	<ul>About Chuck
	<li> Chuck is a 38-year-old male, currently single (but not always so). </li>
		<li> He has a bachelor’s degree in accounting and currently works as a CPA for a mid-sized accounting agency. </li>
		<li> Originally from a suburb outside of Boston, Massachusetts, Chuck moved to Albuquerque for a job and
			because  he liked the area. He currently lives near the Bosque.</li>
		<li> His main pastime when not out birdwatching is browsing Albuquerque’s birdwatching forums and subreddit. </li>
		<li> He is comfortable with technology and primarily uses a Windows desktop PC to access the internet,  though
			he has been known to spend downtime at work browsing on an Apple iPhone. When he observes birds (usually
			alone, sometimes with a friend) in the wild, he writes the details down on a notebook and takes pictures on
			a consumer-quality DSLR with a zoom lens. When he is looking up a bird (assuming he has a cell signal) he
			will look it up on his iPhone.</li>
		<li> He has a bachelor’s degree in accounting and currently works as a CPA for a mid-sized accounting agency. </li>
		<li> If you were around the watercooler with him, he might say “Last week I saw a Rivoli's Hummingbird at the
			trailhead visitor center! I’m going out again this weekend with Nick from my birdwatching group.  He swears
			he saw a Chestnut-Sided Warbler in Bear Canyon. Not sure I believe him but I’m bringing the good zoom lens
			just in case.” </li>
	</ul>
	<h3> Student user story</h3>
	<p>As a university student studying ornithology, I want to make use of the information gathered by citizen
		scientists (and input my own) to study how many birds there are in an area and how they move over time for the
		purpose of scientific study.</p>

	<ul>About Kelly
	 <li> Kelly is a 22-year-old Cornell University junior biology student who is interested in gathering information
		 about birds to study how predation, conservation, and climate change affect their population and distribution.</li>
	<li>She currently lives in Ithaca, New York on the Cornell main campus but is originally from downtown St. Louis,
		Missouri. </li>
	<li>She wasn’t originally that interested in ornithology but through her biology studies she became interested
		in population distribution and what she could learn from citizen science projects like Ebirds. She is
		fascinated by the concept and thinks that it is a neat idea for democratizing scientific research. </li>
	<li>Like most people her age, she is very comfortable with technology. She uses her Macintosh laptop for real
		scientific work and database access, but she keeps an iPad and an iPhone around for medium-size tasks and
		casual reference respectively. </li>
	<li>If you met her in the school cafeteria, she would tell you “I’m excited to see how this current heat wave has
		 affected the population of Ring-necked pheasants in New York. Fingers crossed we get some good data this year!”
