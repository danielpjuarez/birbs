Group Birbs Crew Manifesto

Communication:
<br>•    Primary communication is on Slack and in person 
<br> •    We will handle arguments/disagreements by using our leader (Ruth) as a mediator, where we just make a majority rules type agreement
<br> •    Tuesdays and Thursdays meeting at lunch for fifteen minutes to determine what additional time we need and when we will get together. We will also treat Friday like a full work day, and stay until 5.
<br> •    Asana will be the way that we assign roles and make sure everyone is pulling their weight
<br> •    We will be motivated to follow the rules because of mutually assured destruction (we all win/lose together)
<br> <br>
Roles:
<br>•    Mark is the Chief Engineer (takes lead on coding)
<br>•    Ruth is the Commander (team lead, organizes stuff)
<br>•    Daniel is the Ensign/Gofer(fills in the blanks of what's needs doing)
<br>•    Alistair will be the Lieutenant  (figures out logistics)

Also Important:
<br>•    Appreciation for people: Assume that people are approaching you with the best solution, with positive intent, and that everyone wants to get the project done
<br>•    Celebration: try to celebrate every milestone by getting out early on Fridays, maybe getting pastriesSigned,Ensign Daniel
